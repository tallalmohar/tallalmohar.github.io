## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License.

### Why MIT?

I chose MIT License because it provides a balance between openess and flexibility. It encourages and makes it easy for others to integrate my work into theur own projects. Me being a fan of open source this really is a plus for me. To be able to use my work in persona;, academic or even commerical projects without complex legal obligations is incredibly freeing. The simplicity also reduces legal overhead for both me and other potential users, making the MIT License one of the most developer-friendly open-source licenses available out there.
